### 1- Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, **AtliQ Grands** are losing its market share and revenue in the `luxury/business` hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate **‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù** to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

- **Our Goal**: As a Data Analyst, we aim to help the managing Director by building dashbord that provide Insights from their historical data.
